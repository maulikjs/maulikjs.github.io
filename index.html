            <p align="Justify">We used CT scan slices to generate 3D models of the lung and using their HU values we generated a model of the coherent air cavity. We then trained a C-NN to identify contiguous voxels larger than a specific size which might indicate cancer. Our results were comparable to the Top 50 teams that participated in the Kaggle Competition. We used scipy, skimage, tensorflow packages to run the experiment. </p>

            <p align="Justify">We developed an app for BU which would act as a common platform for all organizations to publish their events and for students to RSVP & Check-in to the event. Each oraganization can publish their events to the calendar with options like open-for-all or for selected majors and the respective students can see and access those events. The organizations can also issue ticekts and the students can check-in using QR codes. The backed and web-app was made using Ruby on Rails and the app was made using Java on Android Studio.</p>

            <p align="Justify">Built a system in .Net and a supporting Android app. During lunch hours canteens get really busy and everyone cant be served efficently. So we developed a system where the students can place an order before hand and pick up his meal when he reaches the canteen. We also improved canteen efficiency by using a Forecasting model to predict demand for various dishes during various times of the day and dynamic inventory management which would be updated approximately with each order and would predict future state of the inventory and prompt the manager to restock various items. We also offered PoS order taking and printing and sales data visualization. We also performed Market Basket analysis for each user to generate personalized offers.</p>
